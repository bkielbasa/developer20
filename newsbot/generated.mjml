        <mj-text font-family="helvetica">Hello!</mj-text>
        <mj-text font-family="helvetica">I hope you have a great day. It's Friday so I'm sending you the newest set of useful materials for you. Today, you'll read about some tips for testing API clients, a list of 25 lessons from 25 years of coding and more. Unfortunetly, there are no new interesting language changes in Go. <br />Happy reading!</mj-text>

        </mj-text>
        <mj-text>This workshop will provide best practice real world advice for teams building projects in Go covering five areas:

- Idiomatic code
- Package and API design
- Error handling
- Concurrency
- Testing

I watched the video and I must say that I almost always agree with him. Strongly recommended!</mj-text>

        <mj-text>4 Tips for Testing Your API Client. What&#39;s worth remembering is the fact how setup and teardown look like in tests. It&#39;s very clever way of doing it clear and not-clever way :) if you know what I mean.</mj-text>

        <mj-text>Cross compilation in Go is awesome. Since go1.18 we&#39;ll be able to target specific AMD64 architecture: v1 (default), v2, v3 and v4.</mj-text>

        <mj-text>This is not, to be exact, breaking printf but a warning against using the unsafe package if you&#39;re not fully aware of consequences of using it.</mj-text>

        <mj-text>Today is my birthday which means I&#39;ve been coding for 25 years. A quarter century ðŸ˜± Here&#39;s 25 lessons I&#39;ve learned about code. In no particular order.</mj-text>

        <mj-text>Comments that are easy to grok and grep. I really like the idea. It&#39;s very difficult to give a good feedback. This convention will help you to do it. I&#39;ve just stated using it so if you like it too - let me know!</mj-text>

        <mj-text>Cryptocurrencies are getting more and more popular. If you have a e-store, maybe accepting bitcoin payments is something for you. I didn&#39;t know that paypal provides crypto payments.</mj-text>
