This is very a very popular question asked by beginners. Surprisingly, it's not a simple question with easy answer. In this article, I'll try to answer this question and give you some suggestions you may find helpful.

## The programming language matters

From many people you'll hear that the programming language (PL) does not matter. That's true as long as you just want to start programming. Every technology has his toolchain and set of rules which may not apply in other technologies. For example, maven will be needed only in JVM-based programming languages. NPM or RubyGems are strictly related with specific PL. While learning Scala or Haskell or any other functional programming language, you'll use to other patterns than while learning object-oriented PL.

The programming language matters because it gives the very first background. If you'd like it, it's more possible that you'll stick to it for a longer time. It may become important when you know, in general, what you want to do. Solutions where you code is compiled to a machine code like c, c++, Go or Rust are more likely used in game development or in the infrastructure code. On the other hand, they are much less used in mobile or web development.

## Which programming language learn?

The area of the software development may not be the only criteria for choosing your technology. We'll focus on the most popular and, in my opinion, most important criterias.
