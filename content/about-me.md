Hi! I’m Bartek and I’m a software developer. I love to learn by teaching other and that’s the reason I started blogging. But that’s not all.

I started appearing in front of the audience on various company events. I really liked it.

I work as the developer since 2011 in a small agency where I learned basics. Throw the past, I realized that programming is not only about programming. It’s something more and this blog is to show you how I think how future developers should or will think.

If you want to contact me just send me a message to the email address bklimczak(at)developer20(dot)com.
