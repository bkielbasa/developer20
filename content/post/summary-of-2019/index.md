This is the very first time I write a summary of a year. I feel that today is the day I should start doing it and that some digits may be interesting for some people.

The biggest change I made this year was changing the blogging platform to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and focused more on Go content. I continued organizing [GoCracow meetup](https://www.meetup.com/GoCracow/). This helped me become a [Google Developer Developer](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-bart_C5_82omiej_klimczak) in Go category.

My first article was [An agony of trying to do the job](https://developer20.com/an-agony-of-trying-to-do-the-job/). Since then, I wrote 27 articles. In 2019, I had 10654 readers (in the year before it was about 2000 readers) mostly from Poland and the United States. The most popular articles are [Writing TCP scanner in Go](https://developer20.com/tcp-scanner-in-go/) (3113 readers) and [When you can lose messages in Kafka](https://developer20.com/when-you-can-nose-messages-in-kafka/) (2132 readers).

I started using Reddit more often and to be honest - it surprised me a lot. The audience there is awesome and I always receive very constructive feedback about my materials.

I started working on a new project which will be released in January 2020. It will be open-source and will focus on promoting the best content about Go.

## The audience

Some facts about the audience:
63% of readers use Google Chrome and 13% use Safari
The most popular operating system is Windows 26% and Mac OS 25%
I had 3 BlackBerry users!
Average session duration is 42 seconds.

Thatâ€™s it for now. If you want to know more facts just let me know in the comments section below. Happy New Year!
