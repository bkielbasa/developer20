There are books that after reading you consider them as "must-read" and you're asking yourself why you didn't read it before. Today is the day when I read the "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World" by Cal Newport for the second time. I don't regret it.

In COVID times, we very often work remotely. It changed a lot in our life as well as in the world. Working from home is cool but, on the other hand, very distracting. Being focused is important. I think we know that but do you know how much?

The author argues that the Deep Work is (and will be) crucial for people who work creatively. What's more, it's rarer and rarer. Many times busyness is a proxy for productivity. It means that people pretend they're working hard by being visible to others.

What I found very interesting is the fact that finishing hard tasks make us happy. Fixing one but hard to find/debug bug makes us happier than fixing 10 small issues. Do you agree with that statement?

There are a few things I like about the book. The first thing is that almost everything is based on some research or experiments. The book has very interesting stories that confirm Cal's point of view. Secondly, it's very practical. You can find 4 disciplines that will help you achieve your goals or suggestions that will minimize distractions.

Sometimes examples in the book are extreme. Can you imagine that the only way to contact you is by sending a letter? Can you imagine that you receive a response from someone within 3 months? Yeah neither do I. 

Deep work is one of those books that the main idea can be put in a medium-length article. On the other hand, those stories and examples help you understand the idea and reasoning behind it.

To sum up: the "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World" book is excellent. I learned a lot from it and it changed my life in some ways. If I can give you a piece of advice about it: introduce as many things as possible to your life because you'll have the biggest motivation for it. After some time you won't even remember what's all about.

If after reading the review the book looks interesting to you, you can buy it [on Amazon](https://amzn.to/371pIyl) (#ad).  Happy reading (in deep focus, of course).
