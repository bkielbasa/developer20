## [Love Bug's creator tracked down to repair shop in Manila](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52458765) #security

The security tag is a bit too much, probably but... The author of "I Love You virus" is known! After 20 years.

One of two interesting posts about how to add something pretty and useful to readers. I'm going to add the progress bar to my blog :)
BTW, do you have any other things that make the blog more user-friendly?

## [Failed #SquadGoals](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/)

Do you remember the Netflix development model? Netflix doesn't use it anymore. Then, you (probably) shouldn't as well.

I hope that everyone knows what pprof is. Is not, read the article right away. It's not very long or deep enough but still worth reading.

## [A curated directory of resources, tools & hacks for non-techs](https://www.nocode.tech/)

We are developers, right? But, we have one cons - we can see code everywhere. Sometimes it's not the case. Sometimes it's easier to build a blog with a newsletter and e-mail marketing without writing a single line of code.

## [Things I Wished More Developers Knew About Databases](https://medium.com/@rakyll/things-i-wished-more-developers-knew-about-databases-2d0178464f78) #database
