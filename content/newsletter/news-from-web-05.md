## [Dgraph, GraphQL, Schemas, and CRUD](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/05/dgraph-graphql-schemas-crud.html) #graphql #dgraph

Quite long article about Graphs and GraphQL. I'd say it's very basic and shows how to run a simple CRUD application using GQL and Dgraph but it can be a good starting point for experiments.
